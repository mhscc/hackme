# What is a HackMe?

Thank you for showing your interest in our challenges.  HackMe is set of coding challenges, and in this repository  we will publish our weekly coding challenges exclusive to the MHS Coding Club members. Challenges will touch on many topics such as encryption, algorithms, and optimization. By attempting, or even better, solving the challenges will massively enhance one's coding and problem-solving skills.

## How to complete a challenge

All the challenges will be written by the officers, and often times in just one language. If the challenge is written in JavaScript, the solution itself would have to be JavaScript, too.

### Developing Environment

With that said, how can you tackle a coding challenge. The simplest way to get started is to use an browser **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (**IDE**) to start writing the code. [Replit](https://replit.com/), for instance,  is a browser IDE, but it supports all the language that we will write our challenges in. However, if you want to setup a local environment, we would recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) apart from the hundreds of other IDE.

### Submit a challenge

 Once you solved the challenge, try redeeming the prize or contact any of our officers to get recognize and end the challenge. There can only be one winners per challenge, so if you got the solution, tell us quickly.

### Additional resources

We'll publish our challenges to GitHub, and it might be a  little confusing to navigate, so use this [two-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cII5ItmiYDY) to familiarize yourself to GitHub.
